# Liri-Node-App

This is a command-line app that is able to take in one of four requests linking to different APIs and output the value as needed. The API's used were spotify, twitter, and omdb. 

For example, one of the requests is "spotify-this-song". In the terminal this request could be added after linking to the node file along with any song(for example: heartless) and the output would look like:

"Heartless"
artist: "Kanye West"
album: "808s & Heartbreak"
preview link: "https://open.spotify.com/artist/5K4W6rqBFWDnAN6FQUkS6x"

This App uses a .env file to secure the API keys as well as a package.json file to store the multiple app dependecies.
